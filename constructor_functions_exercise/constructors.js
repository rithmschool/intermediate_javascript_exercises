//1. Constructors are designed to help create many different instnaces of a specific object
//2. New allows us to use constructors to mimic classes by creating a new Object, assigning this to that object, 
//then returning that object.
//3. From inside a constructor function, this will refer to the nearest parent object - 
//when used with "new", this becomes its own object, otherwise it will default to the window object.
//4. A class is kind of like a template for something we want to create and/or use. An instance of
//that object the result each time we create and use that new class. Instatiating ten copies of one 
//class should give us ten objects of a single class.
